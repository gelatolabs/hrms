<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Bring your pet into work day is usually a peaceful event that results in sheer joy amongst the Megacorpsers. %($employee(1)%)'s decision to introduce their pet jaguar to the team ended to the say the least, tragically. We lost a lot of good people that day. Their insurance will not cover these losses and we wish them all the best in court.</p>

<p>Please go ahead and fire %($employee(1)%).</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Throwing knives can be quite effective when utilized in the right scenario.  In this case %($employee(1)%)'s aim was a tiny bit off and one of their throws ended up in the back of an intern's leg.</p>

<p>Despite their injuries being non life-threatening, acts of such violence are frowned upon here at MegaCorp.  Perhaps they can apply again in the future when they improve their aim.</p>

<p>Please go ahead and fire %($employee(1)%).</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting their replacement.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

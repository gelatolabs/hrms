<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>One of the window cleaning contractors that was hired was recently seriously injured. This was a direct result of %($employee(1)%)'s perfect depiction of a mime pressing up against a glass window. The contractor believed the window to be real and lost his balance, taking a horrible fall. Mr. Hump T.D. will be pressing charges and MegaCorp will transfer all liability to %($employee(1)%). Unfortunately for this to be legal, they must be relieved of their position.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting their replacement.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

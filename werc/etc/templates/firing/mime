<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>One of the window cleaning contractors that was hired was recently seriously injured. This was a direct result of %($employee(1)%)'s perfect depiction of a mime pressing up against a glass window. The contractor believed the window to be real and lost his balance, taking a horrible fall. Mr. Hump T.D. will be pressing charges and MegaCorp will transfer all liability to %($employee(1)%). Unfortunately for this to be legal, they must be relieved of their position.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

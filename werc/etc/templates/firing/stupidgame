<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>%($employee(1)%)'s decision to dedicate an entire 72 hours of company time towards a game development competition may have seemed like a great idea in theory, but in practise it just got them fired. Goodbye!</p>

<p>Please go ahead and fire %($employee(1)%).</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

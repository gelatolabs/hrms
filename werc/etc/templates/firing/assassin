<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Passion is something we care about deeply here at MegaCorp. I'm sure this is precisely one of the reasons you saw such potential in %($employee(1)%). Unfortunately, passion is something that can often lead to obsession and take a turn for the worse. %($employee(1)%)'s infatuation with the leader of the Centerist party and in-depth PowerPoint presentation involving how they planned to relieve them from their duties was more than disturbing. As such, we cannot permit them to carry out such activities on MegaCorp time again.<p>

<p>Please go ahead and fire %($employee(1)%).</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Unfortunately there has been an incident where %($employee%) has been caught playing League of Legends repeatedly while on the job. Despite 20 warnings, they have refused to comply and thus must be terminated. Sadly, this employee was hired by you and we absolutely cannot tolerate failure of this nature. We regret to inform you that you have also been terminated. Security will see you to the parking lot where your vehicle has been conveniently towed. Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp.</p>

<p>Have a pleasant day,<br />
Mister E</p>

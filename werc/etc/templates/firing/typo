<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Even though excellent typing skills are typically associated with higher levels of productivity, in this particular case %($employee(1)%)'s rate of typos has reached astronomically high levels.  It has become so bad that they inadvertently issued a bomb threat to our biggest customer, which resulted in the termination of a multi-million dollar contract.</p>

<p>Please escort them to their vehicle and make sure they turn the key.  You might want to put some distance between yourself and the car before you do.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/firing/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p.Racial slurs are bad enough on their own but we can't believe %($employee(1)%) actually had the audacity to sign up for a Facebook account.  Do they not value the privacy of their data at all?  Everybody knows Facebook is an open book when it comes to distributing personal information to strangers.</p>
 
<p>Normally we could care less but as this occurred on a Megacorp system 1700 documents containing sensitive data were released.  %($employee(1)%) should consider themselves lucky that their only punishment is being fired.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting their replacement.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

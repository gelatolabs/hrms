<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p.Racial slurs are bad enough on their own but we can't believe %($employee(1)%) actually had the audacity to sign up for a Facebook account.  Do they not value the privacy of their data at all?  Everybody knows Facebook is an open book when it comes to distributing personal information to strangers.</p>
 
<p>Normally we could care less but as this occurred on a Megacorp system 1700 documents containing sensitive data were released.  %($employee(1)%) should consider themselves lucky that their only punishment is being fired.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

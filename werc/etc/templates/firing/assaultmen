<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Video surveillance has determined that %($employee(1)%) is the one guilty of the recent disturbing behaviour in the men's washrooms.  Facial recognition software clearly indicates that they are solely responsible for forcefully reaching under cubicle walls to steal pants.  Didn't we pay them enough to buy their own trousers?  A cardboard box has been issued to their cubicle, have them fill it and security will assist them to the nearest exit.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp.</p>

<p>Have a pleasant day,<br />
Mister E</p>

<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Video surveillance has determined that %($employee(1)%) is the one guilty of the recent disturbing behaviour in the men's washrooms. Facial recognition software clearly indicates that they are solely responsible for forcefully reaching under cubicle walls to steal pants. Didn't we pay them enough to buy their own trousers? A cardboard box has been issued to their cubicle, have them fill it and security will assist them to the nearest exit.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

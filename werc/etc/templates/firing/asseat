<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Networking is an important component to any successful career, that being said it should be taken seriously and conducted appropriately.  %($employee(1)%)'s pathetic attempt to help the Director of Human Resources back to their feet from the rear and using what can only be described as a "dog greeting another dog" manoeuvre lead to some quite unsettling instagram photos.</p>
 
<p>The Director is quietly recovering at home but insisted that %($employee(1)%) be removed from the organization permanently.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

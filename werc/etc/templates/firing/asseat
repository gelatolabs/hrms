<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Networking is an important component to any successful career, that being said it should be taken seriously and conducted appropriately.  %($employee(1)%)'s pathetic attempt to help the Director of Human Resources back to their feet from the rear and using what can only be described as a "dog greeting another dog" manoeuvre lead to some quite unsettling instagram photos.</p>
 
<p>The Director is quietly recovering at home but insisted that %($employee(1)%) be removed from the organization permanently.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

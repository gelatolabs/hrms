<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Innovation is one of the keys to corporate success. Innovation in an emerging field such as Virtual Reality dating is an exciting opportunity. What we don't find exciting is when a certain individual decides that they can utilize MegaCorp cloud services to host a server for such an undertaking. Normally we would sue %($employee(1)%) but in this case we were in a good mood and will simply take possession of all their intellectual property and terminate them instead.</p>

<p>Please go ahead and fire %($employee(1)%).</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting a new Junior Synergy Analyst to replace them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

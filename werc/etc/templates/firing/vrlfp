<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>Innovation is one of the keys to corporate success.  Innovation in an emerging field such as Virtual Reality dating is an exciting opportunity.  What we don't find exciting is when a certain individual decides that they can utilize MegaCorp cloud services to host a server for such an undertaking.  Normally we would sue %($employee(1)%) but in this case we were in a good mood and will simply take possession of all their intellectual property and terminate them instead.</p>

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp.</p>

<p>Have a pleasant day,<br />
Mister E</p>

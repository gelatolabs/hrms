<p>Dear %($username%),</p>

<p>It has come to our attention that %($employee(1)%) has been found sniffing the feet of certain female employees. As much as this creates fantastic cooler talk, some of the victims are threatening to sue us if we don't act. You know what to do.</p>

<p>Once that's taken care of, you can get straight to work on selecting their replacement.</p>

<p>Turnover is natural and to be expected with such a demanding position as Junior Synergy Analyst, so rest assured this particular incident will not be reflected on your performance review.</p>

% goodness=`{cat $userdir/emails/$email/goodness}
% if(test $goodness -ge 0) {
<p>%($employee(1)%)'s performance was otherwise excellent. Keep up the good work.</p>
% }
% if not if(test $goodness -le -3) {
<p>That said, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was still quite poor. Please hire someone competent next time or risk meeting the same fate as %($employee(1)%).</p>
% }
% if not {
<p>This incident aside, %($employee(1)%)'s overall performance was about average. I'm sure you can do better.</p>
% }

<p>Thank you for your service @ MegaCorp and have a pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mister E</p>

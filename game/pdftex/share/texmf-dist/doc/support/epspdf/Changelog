2020-01-09 0.6.5

	Ghostscript invocations: no more .setpdfwrite, which is now
	deprecated

	epspdftk: improved handling of selection of Unix pdf- and
	Postscript viewers

	Updates to the manual

2019-02-01 0.6.4

	pdf_crop: epdf replaced by pdfe if available (LuaTeX >= 1.9)

	Better handling of pdfs with negative coordinates in MediaBox and
	some corner cases

	Ghostscript: support for later versions of pdf format

	Eps files with large boundingbox coordinates: added a -r300
	resolution parameter when asking Ghostscript to calculate their
	boundingbox. Hopefully, this prevents grossly inaccurate results.

	Pdftops on Windows: always use pdftops from searchpath

	Some refactoring

	epspdftk: no more black console windows under windows

	epspdftk: use of ttk widgets; no more support for Tk versions
	prior to 8.5.

	epspdftk: updated selection of viewers under `plain unix'

	Updates to the manual

2016-05-06 0.6.3

	Pdf page selection and cropping: simplified and updated the
	generated TeX file to be compiled by LuaTeX. Now compatible with
	both LuaTeX 0.95 and older versions.

	Windows: test whether pdftops is in TeX binary directory. If so,
	do not offer a configuration option for the location of pdftops.

	Minor tweaks to the manual

	Windows executable once more based on Tclkits from Patrick Thoyts
	at http://www.patthoyts.tk/tclkit/

2015-10-28 0.6.2

	Replace obsolete luatex primitives \pdfpagewidth and
	\pdfpageheight with \pagewidth and \pageheight respectively

	Minor tweaks to the manual

2014-11-30 0.6.1

	Windows ececutable based on a newer tclkit, from the KitCreator
	project (http://kitcreator.rkeene.org/fossil/index). This
	necessitated a new test for being a starpack, viz. by checking the
	name of the executable, instead of the previous test for
	tclkitpath.

	Epspdf now modifies the process searchpath and calls luatex,
	ghostscript and pdftops by basename to sidestep problems with
	spaces in path names, especially on Windows.

	Removed use of cmd /c, which was a bug workaround for some old
	version of LuaTeX.

	Some code cleanup(?): fewer globals, all non-trivial
	initialization in one block following the function definitions.

	The temporary directory has been placed under %TEMP% under
	Windows, and under either $TEMPDIR or /tmp on other systems.

	To give Windows >= Vista a better chance to remove temporary
	files, epspdf first waits one second.

	Check for epswrite/eps2write ghostscript output devices.

	epspdftk.tcl: updated list of Unix PostScript- and pdf viewers.

2013-02-07 0.6.0

	Command-line component rewritten in TeXLua

	Texlua's epdf library replaces Ghostscript's pdf2dsc.ps.

	Grayscaling done by Ghostscript; both old grayscaling options now
	do the same thing.

	When going from eps to pdf, a PostScript wrapper is no longer
	used. Instead, Ghostscript now takes care of translating the eps
	boundingbox to a pdf MediaBox. This implies that the hires
	boundingbox will be used if available.

	Pdf crop adapted from Heiko Oberdiek's pdfcrop perl script

	ATM custom options for GhostScript and pdftops are no-ops.

	AppData is once more read from the environment, because texlua
	does not provide access to the registry.

	AppleScript wrapper dropped since I no longer own a Mac.

2011-02-27 0.5.3

	Windows: AppData now read from registry, because this value may not
	always be available as environment variable

	AppleScript wrapper now uses `do shell script' with some
	heuristic path additions, instead of `tell application Terminal
	do script'

2010-12-25 0.5.2

	Eliminate need for wrappers under Unix, as suggested by
	Peter Breitenlohner; update manual

2010-05-09 0.5.1

	Bug fix: test for i_hrbb >= 0 instead of true

2010-02-28 0.5

	GUI module replaced with separate Tcl/Tk frontend. To this end,
	epspdf.rb now has options for reading/writing settings over
	stdin/stdout.

	Epspdf.rb now also aborts on Unix if Ghostscript is missing.

	Both logs and config moved to subdirectory: %APPDATA%/epspdf
	under Windows, $HOME/.epspdf otherwise. On-demand log window.

	Logo/icon added

	Documentation updates

	Manual in info format is now part of the distribution

2009-09-11 0.4.3

	Patch for Ruby 1.9 compatibility (Ruben Stein). Patch for
	compatibility with newer Ghostscript under Windows. Fix for option
	gRAY with ps => pdf. `epspdf --version' now prints
	version. Documentation updates.

2009-09-11 0.4.2

	More liberal documentation license. Slight documentation updates.

2009-03-12 0.4.1

	Documentation: added section on bitmaps. Windows setup program:
	added missing Tcl/Tk licenses. Mac: double-clickable epspdftk.app
	with included epspdftk replaces double-clickable epspdf.app
	add-on.

2009-03-02 0.4

	Handles hires boundingbox. Can use MikTeX Ghostscript. Updated,
	streamlined Ruby subset. Simpler testing of prerequisites.  In
	particular, no pdftops version testing. More tolerant boundingbox
	parsing. Windows: View with... button. OS X: use open command for
	viewing. Converting... text in main window.

2008-07-28 0.3

	TeX Live integration. Packaging for CTAN. Bug fixes: more tolerant
	pdftops version testing; no inappropriate warning about missing
	viewers under Mac OS X.

2006-11-20 0.2.12

	Bug fixes: log rotation now works. Solved quoting problems under
	w2k by using short names. Minor updates to documentation.

2006-11-03 0.2.11

	Minor fixes. Changes in documentation.

2006-10-29 0.2.10

	Computed boundingbox padded by 1pt, to prevent some
	cropping. Amount bb_spread is manually configurable. The File Open
	dialog remembers the last directory visited (between function
	calls, not between program sessions). Changes in documentation.

2006-08-14 0.2.01

	epspdf.app now packaged separately. Bug fix to Applescript applet
	epspdf.app for starting up epspdftk under Mac OS X.

2006-07-30 0.2

	Original release
